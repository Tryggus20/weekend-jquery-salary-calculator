# Project Name
Salary Calculator Wireframe

## Description

_Duration: 5 Hours  _

I have developed a project that takes an employee's information such as name, id number, title, and annual salary. It then displays that employee in the table and calculates the total monthly salary. If the total monthly salary goes above $20,000, the number turns red. Each employee can be removed from the table with a click of their corresponding button.

## Usage
An employer can utilize this project to quickly see if payroll is over budget

1. Enter Information in the input fields
2. Click the button to add the employee
3. Check total monthly salary
4. If needed, can remove any employee in the table
5. If above $20,000 a month, it alerts you with a color change
